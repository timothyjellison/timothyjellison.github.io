# timothyjellison.github.io

My blog, created with Jekyll.

## Local Development

Run `./start.sh` from the root directory. The site will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.

## Writing Posts

All posts are written in the `_posts` directory. For convenience, start from the available `yyyy-mm-dd-template.md` file.
